			Ahoj, přátelé, to a universe where we're all kin.

			<br><br></p>

A haunting musical journey shaped by 40+ years of living. Delicate vocals, mesmerizing fingerpicking, and an homage to myriad singer-songwriters and folk musicians across time and space. Inspired by ki, the mother of the Muses and goddess of memory, kinship, ancient wisdoms, multifaceted truths, and led by a multi-instrumentalist living on unceded lands in Portland, OR —ChatGPT and KÍmNEMÁ

				Mother Mountain, give me strength and the courage to stand tall.
				Give me patience, Father Time, I deserve, deserve it all.
				Hold me Sister Ocean, drown my sorrows in your seas.
				Hush me Brother Wind, take these voices, quiet me.
				Friends, give me ice when I’m about to boil; give me fire when my heart is cold.
				Cousins Trees, give me roots so I can grow where I belong.
				Universe, give me song.

Remember when we used to sneak into the drive-in by playing sleep? She'd throw a blanket on us to be safe and we'd magically wake up for the movie and get tucked back in for the second feature. Today, the river beckons me to drive in and I watch, wide awake.



				Remember when you used to sneak us into the drive-in by having us play sleep in the back where only children could squeeze? You'd throw a blanket on us to play it safe. We'd play sleep again when you wanted to stay for the second, scary, feature. I watched most of the Poltergeist peeking through space of the headrest that your boyfriend would have blocked had he not been holding you. Today, the river beckoned me to drive-in and I found myself watching wide awake.



				Remember when I'd wear my sister's jeans, my only pair of boots which just happened to be "combat boots," paired with a non pressed, unbuttoned, white shirt? I typically had a black tank underneath and absolutely perfected the "I don't give a shit" look which in turn was polished by the Marlboro Reds I'd tote around. Those boots went fishing, drove mains, stomped through fields, moshed at festivals. I conquered the world in those boots.


				Remember when we pulled the dressers and beds away from the walls so we had long hallways to get lost in? Now we spend our time creating worlds with no walls, living in front of everyone.

				
				Remember when we burned all of our furniture, trying to get smoke signals to heaven? We had mighty tasty s'mores that mom would not have approved of were she still alive.



				And we sat like this, hands over eyes, for what must have been seconds that each lasted a day. I don't think he caught me peeking, but there were times I really had my eyes closed so I couldn't tell if he ever peeked. Sometimes I liked to pretend I could feel it, like when I close my eyes at a stop light and practice my skills at knowing when the light turns green. His eyes were green like the stop lights and they begged me to keep going. To keep playing. We must have played peek-a-boo for years that paraded as seconds.


				Lucky was born Lucky Larus, unfortunately named after a duck though she was a superior, "ravenous sea bird." Her moms named her, knowing the chance of their offspring hatching were low. She wears her non mating plumage to ward off the pesky males during the winter season when she must keep her focus on foraging from the dump and stealing what she can from the cormorants. They deserve it, she once squawked, sharing how they trick young gulls into accepting human treats. What the young gulls don't know (and the cormorants knowingly don't share) is that human food is addicting and unreliable. The humans must dispense it and once they stop, they don't care for being pestered ... and will kill the gulls. For this reason, she sees herself as a Robin Hood, stealing to keep the young gulls safe.


				Remember when we'd stay up late, writing letters under our covers, hoping our parents wouldn't notice the glow of flashlight emanating from our beds? Sometimes our letters would be to each other, and we'd exchange them via a postage stamped envelope, doodled to depict our dream travels. Other times, they'd be to our fictional best friends, our journals who'd never turn a deaf ear or tattle on our evil desires or embarrass us for our youthful lack of emotional control. 


				Remember when grandpa would pull out all of his puzzles, none of which laid flat on a table? And that ship in a bottle? Life was filled with countless mysteries, all of which made adulthood feel like a destination worth striving for...when mysteries would solve themselves, and we'd have new children to tease.
